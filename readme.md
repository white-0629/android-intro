# Activity Demo

The `Activity Demo` project is an Android application that provides examples of various UI elements and controls that can be used in Android apps.

## Functionality
- The main activity includes a `ListView` that shows the names of the available UI examples.
- When a list item is clicked, it launches the corresponding example activity.
- The main activity uses an `ArrayAdapter` to display the list of activity names in the `ListView`.
- The names are stored in an array of strings.
- The main activity defines a method to launch the corresponding activity based on the clicked item.

The project includes many example activities that illustrate the use of various UI elements and controls. These include activities for:
- Checkboxes
- Date pickers
- List views
- Progress bars
- Radio buttons
- Ratings
- Spinners
- Switches
- Time pickers
and more

Each example activity provides an example of how to use a specific UI element or control in an Android app. Some of the examples are simple and provide only basic functionality, while others are more complex and demonstrate more advanced features.

Overall, the `Activity Demo` project provides a good starting point for developers who are learning Android app development and want to explore the various UI elements and controls that are available in the Android SDK.
