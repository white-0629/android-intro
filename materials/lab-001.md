## Guide for Completing the GoslingLoveLace Application
1. Create a new application in Android Studio:
   - Open Android Studio and select "Start a new Android Studio project" from the welcome screen. 
   - Follow the prompts to create a new project, naming it "GoslingLoveLace."
   
2. Create an activity:
   - In the project structure, navigate to the "java" folder and create a new Java class for the main activity if it does not exist yet.
   - This activity should extend the "AppCompatActivity" class and implement the necessary methods for its lifecycle.
   
3. Add the logic to show Gosling's information in portrait mode:
   - In the main activity, use ImageViews to display images and TextViews to display information about James Gosling.
   - Use a ScrollView to make the information scrollable.
   
4. Add the logic to show LoveLace's information in landscape mode:
   - In the main activity, use ImageViews to display images related to Ada Lovelace.
   - Use TextViews to display information about Ada Lovelace.
   - Use a ScrollView if needed
   
5. Adjust the design based on screen orientation:
   - In the project's "res" folder, create separate layout files for portrait and landscape modes.
   - Use the appropriate layout file for each mode in the main activity.
   
6. Adjust the content based on device default language:
   - In the project's "res" folder, create separate "strings" files for Chinese and English languages.
   - Use the appropriate strings file for the device's default language in the main activity.
   
7. Test the application:
   - Run the application on an Android Virtual Device or a physical Android device.
   - Ensure that the information and design are displayed correctly in both portrait and landscape modes.

    <summary>What is a zip file?</summary>
A `zip` file is:

- A compressed archive file format
- A way of storing multiple files into a single file
- A common method of reducing file size or facilitating file transfer

Zipping a folder is a process of compressing a folder and its contents into a single file. This makes it easier to transfer the folder, save disk space, or archive the data. Here's how to zip a folder on Mac and Windows:

## Mac
1. Right-click the folder you want to zip
2. Select "Compress [Folder Name]"
3. A new file with a .zip extension will be created in the same directory as the original folder

## Windows
1. Right-click the folder you want to zip
2. Select "Send to"
3. Click "Compressed (zipped) folder"
4. A new file with a .zip extension will be created in the same directory as the original folder

    <summary>Why does the application constantly crash when I try to display a large image in an Image View?</summary>

An app may crash when a very large image is put inside an `ImageView` because it can cause memory issues. When the image is too big, it will take up a large amount of memory, which can cause the app to crash or slow down. Here's how to fix this issue:

1. Downsize the image: Resize the image to a smaller size that is appropriate for the target device's screen size and resolution. This can be done using image editing tools like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.
2. Use an image loading library: Use an image loading library such as Picasso or Glide to load images efficiently into the `ImageView`. These libraries have built-in mechanisms for caching and downscaling images, which can help reduce the memory usage of large images.
3. Use a lower-resolution image: If the image is for decorative purposes only, consider using a lower-resolution version that is more appropriate for the target device's screen size and resolution.
4. Implement pagination: If the app requires displaying a large number of images, implement pagination to load only a small number of images at a time. This can help reduce the memory usage of the app and prevent it from crashing.
5. Use the `Bitmap` class: The `Bitmap` class provides several methods to handle large images efficiently, such as the `inSampleSize` method, which can be used to downscale an image to a smaller size.

    <summary>Which text content should I use for the Ada Lovelace and James Gosling TextViews?</summary>


### Raw text Ada Lovelace
```
Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer who lived in the 19th century. She is widely regarded as one of the first computer programmers, and is known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, an early mechanical general-purpose computer. Born in 1815, Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron and showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science.

Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine and wrote several notes on the engine, including an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers. Her notes on the engine, which were published in 1843, are considered to be the world's first published algorithm intended for implementation on a computer. Her writings about the engine showed a clear understanding of the potential for computers to be used for much more than just calculations and demonstrated her ability to think creatively and beyond her time.

Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as one of the first computer programmers and her work is considered to be a foundational piece of the history of computing. She is credited with being the first person to suggest that a machine like the Analytical Engine could be used for purposes beyond calculation, such as creating music and graphics.

In addition to her work on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace was an accomplished mathematician and wrote extensively on the topic. She is known for her contributions to the field of mathematics and her work continues to be relevant and inspiring to this day.

The programming language Ada was named after her, in recognition of her contributions to the field of computing. Ada Lovelace's work continues to be celebrated and her legacy lives on as an inspiration to women in science and technology.
